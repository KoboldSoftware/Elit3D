Tile Map Editor 3D is a tile-based map editor in 3D. Composed of several layers of tiles and 3D objects, it allows you to export the maps in different formats.
## Main Goal
The goal of this project is to create a tool to create RPG maps like Pokémon 4th Gen. Will allow to import 3D models, brushes to build terrain, paint planes at differenent heights with tiles and create inclined sprites. e.g.
